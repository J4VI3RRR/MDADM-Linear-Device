# MDADM-Linear-Device
Software to implement Linear Device functionality in mdadm for JBOD with caching and networking in C. Software contains a client component that connects to the JBOD server and executes JBOD operations over a network. A Linux kernel module emulating linear RAID, optimizing I/O latency by 30-40% through LRU caching. Implemented thread-safe disk aggregation with mutex locks, handling 100+ concurrent operations.
